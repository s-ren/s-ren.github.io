While effective in traditional software ecosystems, these programs face unique challenges in the context of smart contracts. Smart contracts run on blockchains, manage financial assets, and are typically authored by pseudonymous developers. As a result, when vulnerabilities are discovered, security researchers often lack a secure and reliable channel for disclosure. Existing workarounds, such as encrypting messages to contract authors’ public keys, introduce inefficiencies and privacy risks, since ciphertexts themselves may reveal the presence of bugs. We propose DeadDrop, the first system to support oblivious bug reporting for smart contracts. DeadDrop combines oblivious message retrieval (OMR) with a trusted execution environment (TEE) to enable researchers to privately and efficiently deliver vulnerability reports without revealing their intended recipient or overwhelming authors with spam. Our design specifies security requirements for such a system, presents practical techniques for handling long messages, and introduces a bug specification language to formalize submissions. We implement a prototype and evaluate its performance, demonstrating that oblivious bug reporting is both feasible and efficient, achieving an amortized processing time of approximately 3 ms per submission. Finally, we discuss incentive mechanisms to encourage participation, highlighting open challenges for decentralized bug bounty ecosystems.","/DeadDrop_preprint.pdf",3,"src/content/research/deaddrop.mdx","aa1a6b46d20c0890",true,"delegation",{"id":20,"data":22,"filePath":28,"digest":29,"deferredRender":19},{"title":23,"status":24,"abstract":25,"url":26,"order":27},"An Algebraic Approach to Asymmetric Delegation and Polymorphic Label Inference","Silei Ren, Coşku Acay, Andrew C. Myers; ESORICS 2025","Language-based information flow control (IFC) enables reasoning about and enforcing security policies in decentralized applications. While information flow properties are relatively extensional and compositional, designing expressive systems that enforce such properties remains challenging. In particular, it can be difficult to use IFC labels to model certain security assumptions, such as semi-honest agents. Motivated by these modeling limitations, we study the algebraic semantics of lattice-based IFC label models, and propose a semantic framework that allows formalizing asymmetric delegation, which is partial delegation of confidentiality or integrity. Our framework supports downgrading of information and ensures their safety through nonmalleable information flow (NMIF). To demonstrate the practicality of our framework, we design and implement a novel algorithm that statically checks NMIF and a label inference procedure that efficiently supports bounded label polymorphism, allowing users to write code generic with respect to labels.","https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/978-3-032-07901-5_17",2,"src/content/research/delegation.mdx","ff277d2965abda1e","poison-attack",{"id":30,"data":32,"filePath":38,"digest":39,"deferredRender":19},{"title":33,"status":34,"abstract":35,"url":36,"order":37},"The Price of Tailoring the Index to Your Data: Poisoning Attacks on Learned Index Structures","Evgenios M Kornaropoulos, Silei Ren, Roberto Tamassia; SIGMOD 2022","The concept of learned index structures relies on the idea that the input-output functionality of a database index can be viewed as a prediction task and, thus, implemented using a machine learning model instead of traditional algorithmic techniques. This novel angle for a decades-old problem has inspired exciting results at the intersection of machine learning and data structures. However, the advantage of learned index structures, i.e., the ability to adjust to the data at hand via the underlying ML-model, can become a disadvantage from a security perspective as it could be exploited. In this work, we present the! rst study of data poisoning attacks on learned index structures. Our poisoning approach is di\"erent from all previous works since the model under attack is trained on a cumulative distribution function (CDF) and, thus, every injection on the training set has a cascading impact on multiple data values. We formulate the! rst poisoning attacks on linear regression models trained on a CDF, which is a basic building block of the proposed learned index structures. We generalize our poisoning techniques to attack the advanced two-stage design of learned index structures called recursive model index (RMI), which has been shown to outperform traditional B-Trees. We evaluate our attacks under a variety of parameterizations of the model and show that the error of the RMI increases up to 300X and the error of its second-stagemodels increases up to 3000X.","https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3514221.3517867",1,"src/content/research/poison-attack.mdx","dd79ffda519953d0","type-confusion",{"id":40,"data":42,"filePath":48,"digest":49,"deferredRender":19},{"title":43,"status":44,"abstract":45,"url":46,"order":47},"Security Type Confusion","Silei Ren, Suraaj Kanniwadi, Hanxi Chen, Andrew C. Myers; In Submission","Type systems are a lightweight way to obtain assurance that code enjoys useful properties, including security properties. But in decentralized settings such as smart contracts and federated distributed systems, malicious adversaries may not obey the type system. They may attempt to confuse trusted code by supplying values that do not behave as their advertised type claims. We show that well-known attacks such as Confused Deputy Attacks (CDAs) and reentrancy attacks can be understood as instances of this kind of type confusion. In this paper, we show how to obtain the guarantees of a type system despite the presence of malicious type confusion, using a novel mechanism that combines static and dynamic information flow checking. We give an information-flow-typed core calculus with a run-time enforcement mechanism, and formally prove the security of this mechanism as a hyperproperty-preserving simulation between ill-typed and well-typed programs. With this mechanism, programmers can write code while pretending that adversaries are constrained to obey the type system. The security properties enforced by this ideal system continue to hold in the real system where adversaries lie about types.","/type-confusion.pdf",4,"src/content/research/type-confusion.mdx","afcb1f1eb2ccb0ce","posts",["Map",52,53,90,91],"customizing-theme-color-schemes",{"id":52,"data":54,"body":65,"filePath":66,"assetImports":67,"digest":69,"rendered":70},{"author":55,"publishDate":56,"title":57,"tags":58,"description":61,"cover":62},"VicBox",["Date","2024-12-20T15:20:35.000Z"],"Customizing color schemes of Astro Simple Portfolio",[59,60],"color-schemes","docs","A complete guide on how to customize user information in this Astro Simple Portfolio theme.",{"src":63,"alt":64},"__ASTRO_IMAGE_./images/customizing-theme-color-schemes/cover.webp","Customizing color schemes","Astro Simple Portfolio provides a straightforward way to adapt to your system’s light and dark mode preferences. By default, when a user’s device is set to dark mode, the site will load in dark mode—otherwise, it displays in light mode.\n\n> **Note:** This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of Tailwind CSS and how it’s configured in Astro.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n1. [Introduction to System-Preferred Light & Dark Mode](#introduction-to-system-preferred-light--dark-mode)\n2. [Enabling or Disabling Dark Mode Support](#enabling-or-disabling-dark-mode-support)\n3. [Updating Tailwind Config](#updating-tailwind-config)\n4. [Testing Your Changes](#testing-your-changes)\n5. [Additional Tips & Best Practices](#additional-tips--best-practices)\n\n---\n\n## Introduction to System-Preferred Light & Dark Mode\n\nBy default, **Astro Simple Portfolio** detects your system preference using the `prefers-color-scheme` media query. This means:\n\n- If your device is set to **light mode**, the site appears in light mode.\n- If your device is set to **dark mode**, the site appears in dark mode.\n\nNo extra toggle or button is included in this template—**the theme switch happens automatically** based on the user’s system settings.\n\n\n## Updating Tailwind Config\nTailwind uses color variables to define how your site looks in light and dark mode. You can modify these variables in tailwind.config.mjs. Below is an example snippet:\n\n```js\n// file: tailwind.config.mjs\ncolors: {\n// Light mode colors\n'light-theme': '#E9EBEC',\n'primary-light': '#FBD144',\n'primary-hover-light': '#FFE071',\n\n// Dark mode colors\n'dark-theme': '#0C151D',\n'primary-dark': '#FFE071',\n'primary-hover-dark': '#FBD144',\n\n// Neutrals\n'n900': '#222222',\n'n700': '#171F26',\n'n500': '#555555',\n}\n```\n### Changing the Default Palette\n1. Choose which colors to modify\n   - Want a new background color? Update light-theme or dark-theme.\n   - Want to tweak highlights or accents? Change primary-light, primary-hover-light, primary-dark, and primary-hover-dark.\n   \n2. Replace the color values\n   For instance, if your brand color is teal, you might set primary-light to #3AB7BF and primary-hover-light to #37A1A8.\n\n3. Save and rebuild\nTailwind will regenerate the necessary utility classes when you save and restart your Astro development server.\n\n---\n\n## Testing Your Changes\n1. Local Development Preview\nRun your local dev server with npm run dev or yarn dev.\n   - Switch your system settings between light and dark mode to ensure the site updates automatically.\n\n2. Cross-Browser Checks\nTest your portfolio in multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and devices (desktop, mobile) to confirm everything looks consistent.\n\n3. Accessibility & Contrast\n   - Use tools like WebAIM Contrast Checker to verify your text has high enough contrast against the background.\n   - Ensure buttons, links, and icons remain visible and legible in both modes.","src/content/posts/customizing-theme-color-schemes.md",[68],"./images/customizing-theme-color-schemes/cover.webp","ad74c24a31dcdda4",{"html":71,"metadata":72},"\u003Cp>Astro Simple Portfolio provides a straightforward way to adapt to your system’s light and dark mode preferences.

By editing a few fields, you can make the portfolio entirely your own. This quick guide will show you exactly how to do that.\n\n---\n\n1. ## Locate the Configuration File\nAll the user information you need to update is found in one place:\n\nFile: src/config.ts\nObject Name: ME\nOpen src/config.ts in your preferred code editor, and look for the exported ME object. It should look something like this:\n\n```js\nexport const ME = {\n    name: \"John Doe\",\n    profession: \"Software Engineer | Full Stack Developer\",\n    profileImage: \"pp.png\",\n    profileFacts: [\n        {\n            value: 10,\n            description: \"Years of Experience\"\n        },\n        {\n            value: 5,\n            description: \"Completed Projects\"\n        },\n        {\n            value: 4,\n            description: \"Satisfied Clients\"\n        }\n    ],\n    contactInfo: {\n        email: \"vicbox.dev@vicbox.dev\",\n        linkedin: \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/victor-alvaradohn\",\n        resumeDoc: \"resume.pdf\",\n    },\n    aboutMe: \"I am a software engineer with a passion for web development. I have experience in building web \" + \"applications using modern technologies. I am a self-taught developer who enjoys learning new things and \" + \"sharing knowledge with others.\",\n}\n```\n---\n\n2. ## Update Your Basic Information\nWithin the ME object, you’ll see several properties. Simply replace the default values with your own:\n\n- name: Your full name or preferred display name.\n- profession: Your job title, role, or specialty (e.g., “Web Developer,” “Data Scientist,” etc.).\n- profileImage: The filename of your profile image. Make sure this image is located in the appropriate folder (often public or an images folder).\n- aboutMe: A short bio or summary of your background, interests, and expertise.\n\nFor example:\n\n```ts\nexport const ME = {\n  name: \"Jane Doe\",\n  profession: \"Frontend Developer & UI/UX Designer\",\n  profileImage: \"myProfilePic.png\",\n  //...\n  aboutMe: \"I am a passionate frontend developer with a keen eye for design.
