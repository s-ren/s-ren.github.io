If you’re looking to personalize your Simple Portfolio with Astro Build, one of the first things you’ll want to do is change the default user information. By editing a few fields, you can make the portfolio entirely your own. This quick guide will show you exactly how to do that.

---

1. ## Locate the Configuration File
All the user information you need to update is found in one place:

File: src/config.ts
Object Name: ME
Open src/config.ts in your preferred code editor, and look for the exported ME object. It should look something like this:

```js
export const ME = {
    name: "John Doe",
    profession: "Software Engineer | Full Stack Developer",
    profileImage: "pp.png",
    profileFacts: [
        {
            value: 10,
            description: "Years of Experience"
        },
        {
            value: 5,
            description: "Completed Projects"
        },
        {
            value: 4,
            description: "Satisfied Clients"
        }
    ],
    contactInfo: {
        email: "vicbox.dev@vicbox.dev",
        linkedin: "https://www.linkedin.com/in/victor-alvaradohn",
        resumeDoc: "resume.pdf",
    },
    aboutMe: "I am a software engineer with a passion for web development. I have experience in building web " + "applications using modern technologies. I am a self-taught developer who enjoys learning new things and " + "sharing knowledge with others.",
}
```
---

2. ## Update Your Basic Information
Within the ME object, you’ll see several properties. Simply replace the default values with your own:

- name: Your full name or preferred display name.
- profession: Your job title, role, or specialty (e.g., “Web Developer,” “Data Scientist,” etc.).
- profileImage: The filename of your profile image. Make sure this image is located in the appropriate folder (often public or an images folder).
- aboutMe: A short bio or summary of your background, interests, and expertise.

For example:

```ts
export const ME = {
  name: "Jane Doe",
  profession: "Frontend Developer & UI/UX Designer",
  profileImage: "myProfilePic.png",
  //...
  aboutMe: "I am a passionate frontend developer with a keen eye for design. I love transforming..."
};
```

3. ## Customize the Profile Facts
The profileFacts array is designed to showcase highlights such as years of experience, completed projects, or any other metrics you want to feature. Each fact has two fields:

value: The numerical figure (e.g., 10, 5, 4).
description: A short text explaining what that number represents.
Feel free to add, remove, or edit items in this array to match your background. For example:

```ts
export const ME = {
  //...
  profileFacts: [
    {
      value: 10,
      description: "Years of Experience"
    },
    {
      value: 5,
      description: "Completed Projects"
    },
    {
      value: 4,
      description: "Satisfied Clients"
    }
  ]
};
```

4. ## Update Your Contact Information
If you want to include a contact form or social media links, you can update the contactInfo object. Simply replace the default values with your own:

- email: Your email address.
- linkedin: Your LinkedIn profile URL.
- resumeDoc: The filename of your resume or CV.

For example:

```ts
export const ME = {
  //...
  contactInfo: {
    email: "jane.doe@example.com",
    linkedin: "https://www.linkedin.com/in/jane-doe",
    resumeDoc: "resume.pdf"
  }
};
```

5. ## Customize the About Me Section
The aboutMe property is a free-form text field that allows you to share a brief bio or summary of your background, interests, and expertise. Feel free to update this text to reflect your personality and experiences.

6. ## Save Your Changes
Once you’ve made your updates, save the file and test your portfolio to ensure everything looks as expected. If you encounter any issues, don’t hesitate to reach out for help.

## Conclusion
Customizing your Simple Portfolio with Astro Build is as easy as editing one configuration file. By updating the ME object in src/config.ts, you can quickly tailor the entire site to reflect your personal brand and professional experience.

Feel free to get creative—add new facts, change images, and include links to all your social platforms. With just a few tweaks, you’ll have a portfolio that shows off your work in a polished, professional way.

Happy coding, and enjoy your new personalized portfolio!
