## ‚ú® Solution

### How do users manage finances currently?
We conducted a survey of 20 individuals and found:
- 65% use spreadsheets but find them time-consuming.
- 25% rely on physical notes or memory.
- 10% use financial apps but feel they are overly complicated.

### What features do users value most?
Survey participants ranked the following features as most important:
1. **Expense categorization.**
2. **Budget-setting tools.**
3. **Goal progress visualization.**

### Exploring new financial management tools
We designed a dashboard that combines:
1. **Categorized Expense Tracking:** Auto-categorizes based on transaction type.
2. **Budget Alerts:** Real-time notifications when nearing budget limits.
3. **Savings Gamification:** Rewards users for hitting their financial goals.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Challenges and Learnings
1. **Real-Time Data Synchronization:** Ensuring seamless bank account integration while maintaining security was a technical hurdle.
2. **Balancing Notifications:** Finding the right frequency for alerts to avoid overwhelming users.
3. **Accessibility:** Testing with colorblind users led to revising the color scheme for better visibility.

## ‚ú® Final Thoughts
1. **Data Security is Paramount:** Financial data requires robust encryption and secure APIs for user trust.
2. **Iterative Design Works:** Continuous user feedback helped refine the app to meet real needs.
3. **User Education is Key:** Some users lacked basic financial literacy, so adding educational tips and videos enhanced their experience.
