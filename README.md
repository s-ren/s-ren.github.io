## Configuration

### `src/config.ts`

This file contains several configurations for the site such as the site title, description, other metadata and your
personal details. This file has three main sections:

- SITE

Those sections are arrays of objects that contain the following properties:

#### SITE

}
````

#### SOCIAL

In this section, you can add your social media profiles. Each object should have the following properties:

- `name`: The name of the social media platform.
- `url`: The URL of your profile on that platform.
- `icon`: The icon used for the social media platform. By default, the project already have the most common social media
  platforms. If you want to add a new one, you should add the icon in SVG format in the `src/icons` directory.
- `show`: A boolean value to show or hide the social media platform. I recommend to hide the platforms that you don't
  have a profile and also have as maximum 4 social media platforms.

If you have configured the project correctly, you should see something like this:

![Personal Info Section](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/biography-fa3a3.appspot.com/o/Screenshot%202024-11-22%20at%2018.39.59.png?alt=media&token=444bf708-da0a-4e19-8104-d5d071d73c53)

And also the Meta Tags in the Head of the HTML should be working correctly.

## Add your projects, experiences, and educational information


### Projects (as a Content Collection)

For projects, we are going to use the `src/content/projects` directory. Each project is a separate `.mdx` or `.md` file in this
directory. The file should have the following structure:

| Property   | Type     | Description                                                                                   |
|------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| title      | string   | The title of the project.                                                                     |

| tags       | string[] | An array of tags related to the project.                                                      |
| startDate  | Date     | The start date of the project.                                                                |
| endDate    | Date     | The end date of the project.                                                                  |
| url        | string   | The URL of the project to show a demo or more information.                                    |
| cover      | string   | An image to show in the project card.                                                         |
| ogImage    | string   | An image to show when sharing the project on social media.                                    |                                    |


#### Example frontMatter:

```md

title: ProAccountant Website
summary: Professional Accounting Services Website built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and ShadCN. The site showcases accounting services, features a contact form, and offers a blog section to establish the accountant as an authority in the field.
tags:

    - Next.js
    - ContentFull
    - Motion

ogImage: './images/pro-accountant/accnt.webp'
---
```
If you plan to add images to the project, you should place them in the `src/content/projects/images/` directory.
For a better organization, I recommend creating a separate folder inside `images/` for each project.

### Jobs (as array of objects file)

### `/src/data/Jobs.ts`

Contains the work experience you want to showcase. It's an array of objects where each object represents a job you have
held.

table explaining the properties of each object:

| Property    | Type     | Description                                                           |

| startDate   | Date     | The start date of the job.                                            |

| location    | string   | The location of the company.                                          |
| description | string   | A brief description of the job.                                       |

| currentJob  | boolean  | A boolean value to indicate if you are currently working in this job. |


#### Example:

```typescript
const workExperience: WorkExperience[] = [
    {
        title: "Frontend Developer",
        startDate: "2020-03-10",
        endDate: "", // Leave empty if you are currently working here
        company: "Google Inc",
        location: "United States",
        description: "Developed and maintained web applications using React, NextJs, and Tailwind CSS.",
        goals: [
            "Developed and maintained web applications using React, NodeJs, and MongoDB.",
            "Worked with the team to develop and maintain web applications using React, NodeJs, and MongoDB.",
            "Created and maintained web applications using React, NodeJs, and MongoDB.",
        ],
        currentJob: true,
    },
    // Add more jobs as needed
];

export default workExperience;
```

For better results, I highly recommend using Action Verbs to describe your achievements and responsibilities. Here are
some examples:

- "Developed and maintained web applications using React, Node.Js, and MongoDB.",
- "Worked with the team to develop and maintain web applications using React, Node.Js, and MongoDB.",
- "Created and maintained web applications using React, NodeJ.s, and MongoDB."

### Hard Skills (as array of objects file)

`/src/data/hardSkills.ts`

You can add, edit, or remove entries from these files to customize the content presented on your portfolio. Each file
typically exports an array of objects or strings that are consumed by various components in the project.

## Customization and  Styling

Styles can be customized in the `tailwind.config.js` file
and add your custom styles in the `src/styles/globals.css`.

To customize the colors, you can edit the theme section in the `tailwind.config.js` file.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
        colors: {
            // Light mode colors
            'light-theme': '#E9EBEC', // Background color for light mode
            'primary-light': '#FBD144', // Primary color for light mode
            'primary-hover-light': '#FFE071', // Primary hover color for light mode

            // Dark mode colors
            'dark-theme': '#0C151D', // Background color for dark mode
            'primary-dark': '#FFE071', // Primary color for dark mode
            'primary-hover-dark': '#FBD144', // Primary hover color for dark mode

            'n700': '#171F26', // Text color for light mode
